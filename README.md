Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect various diseases in potato plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By using computer vision techniques, we aim to classify images of potato leaves into different categories based on their health status. Early detection of diseases can help farmers take timely actions to protect their crops, thereby enhancing yield and reducing losses.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of potato leaves with labels indicating different diseases. It includes various disease classes such as:

Late Blight
Early Blight
Healthy Leaves


Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
